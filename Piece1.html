        <h4>Project Objective</h4>

        <p>The Cupcake Boutique is a small retail store specialized in serving (and delivering) baked goods and ice cream. For this project I was required to create a fun, colorful logo for the company as well as business cards and other promotional materials.

        <h4>Concept</h4>

        <p>The creation process depended largely on the feedback I received, initially I designed over 25 different cupcakes, doughnuts and other baked goods. The client chose their favorite and I the composition and font were designed around the chosen illustration. </p>

        <h4> Outcome</h4>

        <p>After exploring different options and variations, the final logo meets its main purpose and is capable of attracting and engaging people of all ages who might enjoy The Cupcake Boutiqueâ€™s products.</p>
