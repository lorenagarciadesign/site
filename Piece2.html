        <h4>Project Objective</h4>

        <p>The goal of the project was to create a poster for the Symphony of Fire, a fireworks festival taking place in several Australian cities. The poster required to show the name of the event, date, time and price of the tickets.</p>

        <img type="images.png" src="images/2.png">


        <h4>Concept</h4>

        <p>The poster displays illustrations of animals as a part of the Australian identity along with fireworks and details of the event. The colour palette consists mainly of bright hues filling the shapes and creating a contrast with the dark background.</p>

     <p> Creating a poster for a fireworks festival was challenging, as I wanted to create a poster that was self-descriptive and didn’t need any words to show what was being promoted and at the same time, create something unique, that represented the Australian identity without falling into clichés, Out of hundreds of Australian symbols, I chose animals because they are capable of appealing all sorts of audiences: kids, young adults and families.</p>      

        <h4> Outcome</h4>

        <p>The outcome is a vibrant, colorful poster that aims to engage people of all ages and encourage them to attend to the festival with their loved ones.</p>
