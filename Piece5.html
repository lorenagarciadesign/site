        <h4>Project Objective</h4>

        <p>City Nest is a mobile app that helps students and young professionals find affordable housing, the goal of the project was to create a logo, an icon and the user interface of the app. The app design had to be modern, intuitive and easy to use. </p>

        <h4>Concept</h4>

        <p>The logo utilizes a modified modern sans serif font with different weights to emphasize The modified “N” is meant to resemble a house/building shape. The app design uses imagery of city elements such as buildings, houses and maps combined with the brand’s colours. </p>

<p>As a UI/UX designer, my main goal was to create a consistent design between the corporate identity and the mobile app design. I started sketching logos and, upon approval, app icons. Once the brand book was created, I started designing the user interface based on continuous feedback. Keeping city and map pictures as background elements gave the interface a modern look without compromising the app’s functionality. </p>

        <h4> Outcome</h4>

        <p>The outcome is a fully functional mobile app with a modern look and intuitive to use for people of all ages. The app is also accessible, as it allows the user to change certain design parameters to make navigation easier for users with visual disabilities: night mode, background colour customization and high-contrast palette.</p>
